## Description
This project was made as a part of the Odin Project. It is a website that showcases some of my favorite skits from the show "I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson". I chose this show because it was one of my favorites and it made the project more interesting. However, the content isn't the most *appropiate* but that's the nature of the show, it's a comedy sketch show. This project was a way to demonstrate and reinforce my HTML, CSS, and Flexbox skills. Flexbox is a 
fun CSS-library that I have been enjoying learning as it is super helpful.

## Challenges Faced
* How to make an image a button
  - This seemed difficult and it kind of was. This was something I had never done before but had seen before so I knew it was possible. 
    I looked around on google for a resource and found an article detailing how you can put an <img> in between <button> and </button>.
    So I did that and it worked but now can the issues of styling the button and having the button open the link in the new tab. 
    I was able to solve the styling issue fairly easily but I had struggled with link opening in a new tab. I had to find an example
    online for this sadly but it was a learning experience none the less and I am happy with the outcome.
    
 * Spacing/Padding everything so it lines up 
    - To ensure everything was lined up properly I ensured every section had a padding on the side, 256pixels to be exact. So I had to hardcode this 
      into every section (header, section one, section two, section three, section four, and the footer) and it works but I feel like there's a more optimal
      way to do this. I tried to do it in the body but it would move the background color as well, which looking back makes sense but in the moment it was 
      odd. I am happy to receive to any advice on this if anyone has any.
